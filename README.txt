Building a One-Size-Fits-All email template
I am building a one-size-fits-all email template, it is the second of 4, so I can observe the differences.
It is not tested for different email clients, I may fully test at a latter date.
If you are looking for a fully tested email template try Litmus or Email on Acid as they distribute copies that can be used immediately.
This is a free source.
You can download the project from GitHub.

I am building this as I like using git and its what people want - code.
